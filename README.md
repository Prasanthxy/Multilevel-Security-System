## Abstract
The "Multilevel Security System" project is designed to enhance security through a dual-layer authentication mechanism. At the first level, it utilizes an I2C EEPROM to store and verify a user-input password. Upon successful verification, it progresses to the second security level, where the system generates a random password and dispatches it to the user's mobile number via UART GSM. Access to the system is granted only when the user correctly inputs both the stored and the dynamically generated passwords. The aim of this project is to create a robust security system that offers enhanced protection through multiple levels of authentication, thereby ensuring secure access control.
